# Kiln-Trace
## Description
Kiln Trace is a CRUD application providing a way to manage the what, when, where, and how of pottery pieces by way of an intuive dashboard system with flexible options for viewing, sorting, filtering, and modifying content.

## Technologies
Kiln Trace is built on TypeScript, React.js, Tailwind, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, and it also leverages Radix UI components through Shadcn UI along with Tanstack's data table API.

## Implemented Features
### Kiln Trace currently offers the ability to:
  - Create, Remove, Update, and Delete "pieces" which are representative of individual ceramic works.
  - View pieces in table or card format.
  - Modify the table layout the handpick displayed information and both filter and sort piece data.
  - Use provided field presets to input information quickly and add preset options of your own.
  - Save customized view, filters, and sorts as "profiles" so that only desired data may be presented with ease.

## Roadmap
### Kiln Trace will offer, in the near future, the ability to:
  - Easily interact with presets and filter profiles by way of a settings menu.
  - Create and login to a profile by way of a secured OAuth system.
  - Create "batches", which will allow for the grouping of multiple pottery pieces related by a specified characteristic into one structure for easy recording and editing.
  - Create a "Studio", which will allow for studio owners to keep track of various information by way of facility.
      - Studios will allow for "artists" to be created, which will offer a new search criterion and responsibility system.
   
### Kiln Trace will offer the ability to:
  - Use a Progressive Web Application (PWA) to facilitate on the fly usage via handheld devices.
  - Use another system meant to keep track of glazes that also follows CRUD format.
      - The glaze system will provide ways to test and record the science behind preparation and maintenance.
      - The glaze system will provide a way to keep track of what glazes are out, and which glazes are on hand.
      - The glaze system will provide a way to record unique mixures of glazes to keep track of unique results.
      - The glaze system will provide a way to record firing temperatures and lengths to keep track of the impact of kiln time on glazes.
  - Use another system to record kiln schedules and their effects.
      - The kiln schedule system will provide a way to normalize firing intervals, lengths, and temperatures.
  - Use another system meant to keep track of glass work.
      - The glass piece system will follow the same format and functionality of the ceramic piece system.

## Motivation
I was inspired to make this application when my fiancee brought to my attention that there wasn't really an all encompassing, digital way to keep track of the work that goes on in a pottery studio. I decided to take that opportunity to create a system that would go above and beyond the needs she described, and serve as a nexus for all operations the would go on in a pottery studio.
